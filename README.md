# DirectedwightedGraph


### **Explanation**
---
Written by eden mor and danielle musai.  
In this task we had to implement a data structure of a directed weighted directed graph 
In Python, the implementation includes the diGraph class as well as the GraphAlgo class. The center idea is to use the previous implementation of our previous task and show it in Python, then we needed to compere our solution performance for our previous implementation in Java.

### **the interfaces we needed to implement in the class GraphAlgo:**
* get_graph – returns the directed graph on which the algorithm works on.
* save_to_json – Saves the graph in JSON format to a file
* load_from_json – Loads a graph from a json file.
* shortest_path –  Returns the shortest path from node id1 to node id2 using Dijkstra's Algorithm
* TSP – Finds the shortest path that visits all the nodes in the list 
* centerPoint - Finds the node that has the shortest distance to it's farthest node.
* plot_graph -  Plots the graph.
